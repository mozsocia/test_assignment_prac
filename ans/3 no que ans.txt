3.Describe the purpose of the distinct() method in Laravel's query builder. How is it used in conjunction with the select() method?


Answer:

The distinct() method in Laravel's query builder is used to retrieve unique values from a column or a combination of columns in the result set. It ensures that duplicate values are eliminated, so each value appears only once in the result.

When used in conjunction with the select() method, the distinct() method allows you to specify which columns should be considered when determining uniqueness. 

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of distinct() in conjunction with select():


$uniqueEmails = DB::table('users')
                ->select('email')
                ->distinct()
                ->get();

In this example, we're querying the "users" table and selecting the "email" column. By applying the distinct() method, we ensure that only unique email addresses are returned in the result set.
